I am **Noor Mohammad Chauhan**.

 am driven by the pursuit of intelligence in machines, which inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Engineering. I’m passionate about uncovering patterns in machine intelligence that could lead to advancements toward Artificial General Intelligence. I actively engage in challenges like the ARC-Prize and AIMO Progress Prize to continuously refine my understanding and skills. My research interests include exploring Liquid Neural Networks, Liquid Foundation Models, and delving into applied machine learning with a focus on abstraction and spatial reasoning in machines. I am also interested in the quantitiative and decisive side of risk management for a asset such as Derivatives and sometimes also CryptoCurrencies.
