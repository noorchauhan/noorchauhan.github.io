Hiking is one of my favourite activities so far. I often hike alone in the woods nearby or sometimes with friends. Summers and Winters are perfect here in my town to hike and explore. I often find myself walking long distances after a long week of staring at the screen due to work or study. There are some exciting stories to tell about hiking which I will write in my blog soon.

## Stories about Ancient Rome

I also sometimes write and learn about ancient Roman emperors. **Julius caesar** is who I often listen to.

<!-- ## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (Q宝).
