Hiking is one of my favourite activities so far. I often hike alone in the woods nearby or sometimes with friends. Summers and Winters are perfect here in my town to hike and explore.

I often find myself walking long distances after a long week of staring at the screen due to work or study. There are some exciting stories to tell about hiking which I will write in my blog soon. My blog has some stories about hikes.

## Stories about Ancient Rome

I also sometimes write and learn about ancient Roman emperors. **Julius caesar** is who I often listen to.
